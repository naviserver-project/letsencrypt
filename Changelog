    added option to produce certificates with ecdsa
    
    Prior to this change, all certificates were using RSA keys.
    Since a while, keys based on elliptic curves became the preference
    of letsencrypt.

commit e9b5197171158206ec29b3cf0be2c08c01a678c8
Author: Gustaf Neumann <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>
Date:   2021-07-19

    Larger overhaul:
    
    - Added ability to obtain certificate in the background
      (useful for automated certificate updates). Previously
      it was just usable via the "letsencrypt.tcl" command.
    
    - Fixed behavior with OpenSSL 3.0: The "openssl" command
      behavior has changed and became more picky. It was
      necessary to pass the option "-passout" to "openssl req -new ...".
      Previously, this was not necessary.
    
    - Added default configuration for "domains" (including multidomain SAN
      domains) via NaviServer configuration file
    
    - Follow usual guidelines for Tcl modules: activate/deactivate module
      via NaviServer configuration file (see README)
    
    - Made ACMEv2 client better configurable (especially useful for
      automated updates)
    
    - Preserve "production" setup and to not clobber with "staging" certificates
      * Use a different name for the .pem file (prefixed with "staging")
      * Perform no automated updates of the server config file (might break
        running web site)
    
    - Bumped version number to 0.6

commit 26507d6a880674da16bda7363bced0bac477640c
Author: Gustaf Neumann <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>
Date:   2019-12-12

    Major overhaul of the letsencrypt module to support ACME v2
    
    ACME (the Automated Certificate Management Environment, [1]) is the
    protocol used for certificate management on letsencrypt.org. The API
    version v was released on 2016 but was updated in 2018 by ACME v2, is
    not backwards compatible with v1. Letsencrypt announced in march 2018
    to drop the support of ACME v1 in several steps:
    
    - Nov 2019: End of account registrations via ACME v1
    - Jun 2020: End of new domain registrations via ACME v1
    - Jun 2021: EOL ACME v1 certificate issuing
    
    The new version is based on its crypto requirements solely on OpenSSL,
    it uses the NaviServer builtins and as well the "openssl" binary (the
    usage of tcllib pki was dropped).  To avoid potential troubles, use
    this with a recent version of NaviServer (currently the tip version
    form BitBucket) or with NaviServer 4.99.19 when this is released.
    
    -g
    
    Unfortunately, i was hit by account registrations issue
    two days ago, so i had to implement v2 to be able to get new
    certificates.

Author: Gustaf Neumann <neumann@wu-wien.ac.at>
Date:   2017-09-13

    code overhaul
    - keep account information data
      (not necessary anymore to create on every request a new account)
    - distinguish between staging account and production account
    - make code object oriented:
       * break up huge proc
       * ease passing around of connection data (e.g. nonces etc)
       * prepare for making the code run in the background
         (by distinguishing between a WebClient and a BackgroundClient)
         will in essence just require generalizing output; this
         will be necessary to automatize certificate renewals

    - less eager re-writing of config file
    - bumped version to 0.2
