This is a NaviServer module that implements a small Let's Encrypt ACME
client for NaviServer.

When running this script, sometimes the Let's Encrypt interface
rejects the keys generated by this script. Probably, the problem
occurs, when the last bit is "0", which is interpreted as a key with
2047 bits:

There is no need to worry about this, since the script will retry with
another set of keys until the operation succeeds, which happens usually
in the send or third attempt.


Requirements:

- NaviServer (4.99.12 or newer) with the integrated OpenSSL support
  activated.
- Tcllib (e.g. 1.15) installed on the Tcl library search path.
- OpenSSL binaries installed (the "openssl" command will be executed
  during certificate generation via "exec")


Installation:

Users might want to run "make install" from this directory to install
the script in the page dir. This is ok for non-public servers, but
otherwise please thinks about a proper space where to place
"letsencrypt.tcl"

OpenACS users might wish to copy it to packages/acs-subsite/www/admin/
such that only admins can execute it. 


Configuration:

See the top section of "letsencrypt.tcl".
